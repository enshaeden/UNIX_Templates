# UNIX_Templates
Templates for use in creating or re-creating various programs, profiles, or aliases

Templates are organized as follows:

h1. General UNIX
Templates can be used cross-platform and should not have any issues between MacOS, all Linux-distros, and Windows with WSL enabled.

h1. Linux-specific
These templates will pretty much work 100% of the time with Linux distros and maybe Windows WSL but are unlikely to find success in MacOS

h1. MacOS-specific
These templates will not work on Linux distros or Windows WSL.
